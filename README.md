# Overview of Employees
- The organization has 1,480 employees, with 238 experiencing attrition, accounting for 16.08%, indicating a significant portion of employees are leaving. Employees earn an average of $6.5K per month.
- There are more male employees (889) compared to female employees (591).
- The average age of employees is 37 years. The largest age group is 26-35 years (41%), followed by 36-45 years (32%). Employees aged 55+ represent only 8%, indicating a younger workforce overall.
- Employees have average of 11.28 years of work experience, with an average working year in the current company being 7.01 years.
- The majority of employees are married (679), followed by singles (473), and divorced employees (328).
- Education Levels: The largest group of employees (39%) has completed education level 3 - bachelor's degree, followed by level 4 - Master's Degree  27%, and level 2 - College's Degree (19%). A smaller percentage of employees have education levels 1 (Below college) and 5 (Doctor).
- Education Field: Life Sciences (607 employees) and Medical (470 employees) dominate the workforce, while fields like Marketing and Technical Degrees have fewer employees (161 and 132, respectively).
- Most employees work in Research & Development (967), followed by Sales (450), and a small group in Human Resources (63).

# Key Factors Impact Attrition
- Job Satisfaction & Role: Laboratory Technician (62), Sales Executive (58), and Research Scientist (47) show higher attrition, particularly with lower job satisfaction ratings (1 and 2). Roles with better job satisfaction like Research Director and Manager have lower attrition, indicating that job satisfaction significantly impacts retention.
- Salary: The majority of employees leaving (163) earn less than 5K, highlighting a clear connection between low salary and higher attrition. 
- Years at Company: There is a significant spike in attrition within the first 1-2 years at the company, particularly during the first year, suggests that employees are most likely to leave early in their tenure. 
- Job Involvement: Employees with lower job involvement scores (1 and 2) show higher attrition, while those with higher involvement (3 and 4) tend to stay longer. This suggests that employees who feel more engaged or involved in their roles are less likely to leave.

# Factors Likely Not Impacting Attrition
- Performance Rating: Although employees with outstanding and excellent performance ratings still leave the company, while no employees with ratings of 1 (Low) or 2 (Good) have left, this suggests that performance rating may not be a significant factor in driving attrition.
- Gender: Attrition is relatively balanced between male (63%) and female (37%) employees, suggesting that gender does not significantly influence the likelihood of attrition.
- Education Field: Attrition rates across education fields are relatively similar. For example, Life Sciences, Medical, and Other education fields have similar attrition rates around 12-13%. Technical Degree and Human Resources show slightly higher rates, but the differences arenâ€™t significant enough to indicate a major factor.
- Distance from Home: Even employees who live 1-3 km near the company still leave, indicating that proximity to work does not prevent attrition. While there are slight peaks in attrition among employees living 10-20 km from work, the overall distribution is fairly even across different distances, suggesting that distance from home does not have a strong impact on attrition.
- Environment Satisfaction: Employees with varying levels of environment satisfaction show only moderate differences in attrition rates. Although those with satisfaction level 2 have higher attrition, the differences are not substantial enough to suggest a major impact.

# Recommendations to Lower Attrition
- **Focus on first-year Retention:** Since attrition is high within the first few years of employment, the company should focus on improving the onboarding experience, offering mentorship programs, and ensuring new employees feel supported in their roles.
- **Revise salary Strategies:** Employees earning less than 5K per month show the highest attrition rates. Offering more competitive pay or revising the compensation structure for lower-paid roles is needed.
- **Address Low Job Satisfaction:** Roles like Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist have higher attrition linked to low job satisfaction. Consider reviewing the job conditions, responsibilities, and satisfaction drivers for these roles to reduce turnover.
- **Improve Job Engagement:** Employees with higher job involvement tend to stay longer. Encouraging employee participation in decision-making, team projects, and professional development programs can increase engagement and reduce attrition across the board.
